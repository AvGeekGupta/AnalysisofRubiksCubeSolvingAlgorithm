## Title - Analysis of Rubik’s cube Solving Algorithms
</h3>  Rubik's Cube or Magic cube is a 3 dimensional combination puzzle which was invented by a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik in the year 1974. There are a number of algorithms to solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. This project aims at analysing various Rubik's cube solving algorithms, thereby comparing and computing their time and space complexities. </h3>

The algorithms in discussion are - 
<ul>
  <li> Thistlethwaite's algorithm </li>
  <li> Kociemba's algorithm </li>
  <li> Korf's algorithm </li>
  <li> Tomas Rokicki's algorithm </li>
</ul>
